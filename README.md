## Introduction

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are powerful tools for image recognition and classification tasks. This repository showcases various CNN projects that aim to solve different image classification problems. Each project includes code, datasets, and detailed explanations to help you understand and implement CNNs effectively.

## Projects

### Rice Classification with TensorFlow and Keras

- **Description:** This project classifies different types of rice grains using CNNs. The dataset consists of images of five types of rice: Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag.
- **Dataset:** The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Techniques Used:** Data augmentation, CNN architecture, early stopping, learning rate reduction.
- **Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **Kaggle Link:** [Click here to check the code](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohmdhmedi/rice-images-cnn)


### Rice Classification with PyTorch

- **Description:** The same dataset with another model. This project uses PyTorch as the second approach.
- **Dataset:** The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Techniques Used:** Data augmentation, CNN architecture, early stopping, learning rate reduction.
- **Framework:** PyTorch
